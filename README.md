I recently worked on creating a comprehensive dashboard in Excel for Netflix Originals, leveraging data visualization and analysis to uncover valuable insights.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Top 10 Language Distribution 📊: I used Excel to showcase the language preferences across Netflix Originals, allowing us to understand viewer engagement by region.

Movie Duration Trends 📈: The chart highlights different duration categories and their frequency, providing a clear snapshot of Netflix's content strategy.

IMDB Rating Distribution ⭐: A detailed breakdown of movie ratings, helping to identify top-performing content.

Yearly Trends Analysis 📅: I used pivot tables to analyze how the release of Netflix Originals has evolved over time.

This project allowed me to leverage my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling to provide actionable insights. I’m eager to apply these insights to drive business decisions.
